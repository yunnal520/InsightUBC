Make sure to follow the *Role, Goal, Benefit* framework for the user stories and the *Given/When/Then* framework for the Definitions of Done! For the DoDs, think about both success and failure scenarios. You can also refer to the examples DoDs in [C3 spec](https://sites.google.com/view/ubc-cpsc310-22w1/project/checkpoint-3#h.8c0lkthf1uae).
